    <p>Split - if the player has two cards of the same value in his hand, then the dealer offers the player a split, that is, breaking one hand into two. In this case, the player makes a bet equal to the previous one. The dealer divides the cards into two hands, deals one card to each and continues to play with the player as if he had originally made two bets.<br /><br />Doubling the bet - the player can double the bet and still receive exactly one card.<br /><br />Rejection of the card - the player can no longer refuse the card that he took.</p>
