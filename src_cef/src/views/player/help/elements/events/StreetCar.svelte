            <strong>How does it work?</strong><br />
            <br />

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                In order to start the race, you need to press the "G" key while in the car, and then select "Street Race";.<br />
                After that, you need to select the player with whom you plan to race on your phone. The player must be near you.<br />
                <br />
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Then you should make a bet, the minimum is $1, the maximum is $100,000.<br />
                And finally, on the map you need to put a finish mark. Good luck on the roads!
