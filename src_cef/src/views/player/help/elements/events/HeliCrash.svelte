            <strong>How does it work?</strong><br />
            <br />

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                The system is available to all players and starts working from 12 pm to 12 am. Every hour, at about 45 minutes, the system gives a notification in the chat that very soon a helicopter will fly over the state, which will transmit a distress signal. 10 minutes after such a notification, the helicopter crashes and a real battle for boxes with valuable drops begins!<br><br>
                The Радиоперехватчик will help you find the helicopter, which will report the exact area of ​​the crash, but you can buy it on the black market (don't forget to take military master keys there too, they will come in handy!). The helicopter, in turn, releases a lot of smoke, which can be seen for several hundred meters!<br><br>
                <br />

                With each crash, 3 boxes will appear around the helicopter, which can be cracked open with a military master key. The contents of the box are different depending on the type of helicopter. For example, you can get, bulletproof vests, materials, rare items can also come across. As well as weapons, rescue kits, and masks, and the chance for a rare item - Epinephrine, using it can lift a player with 100% health.<br><br>
                All actions take place in the main world, so there is a chance to meet someone else and join the fight for the loot received. This system is not subject to DM rules, if you arrive at a place or expect a crash nearby, then you automatically become a participant in this event and you can be killed.<br><br><br>
                We wish you good luck in finding the helicopter and capturing the boxes, the strongest will win!<br>
