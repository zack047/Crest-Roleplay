                In order to start a war, you need to register the command <b>/capture</b> or <b>/bizwar</b> in the appropriate place, and in order to participate as a regular player, you must have
                appropriate access.&nbsp;
            </span>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                All capture And bizwar take place in another world, which means that they are an OOC event, which is why you have the opportunity to teleport to the zone once, using the command <b>/tpcapture</b> And <b>/tpbizwar</b>.<br />
                <br />
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">For each territory or business, the entire faction receives $90 per hour, and&nbsp;</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">when taking all the territories or businesses, the leader of the faction is awarded a nice bonus for this achievement.</span>
